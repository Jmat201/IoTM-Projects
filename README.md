# DataMatch: AI-Powered Resume Optimizer for Job Seekers and Human Resources

## Overview
DataMatch is a sophisticated resume optimization system that leverages AI and machine learning to analyze job listings and help data science professionals tailor their resumes for maximum impact. Using a dataset of 1.2 million LinkedIn job listings and 17 million company profiles, this tool provides data-driven recommendations for resume keywords, skills, and optimizations.

## Features
- **Intelligent Keyword Analysis**: Advanced text analysis of job listings to identify crucial skills and requirements
- **ATS Optimization**: Ensures resumes are optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems
- **Geographic Insights**: Maps job opportunities across U.S. cities for both junior and senior positions
- **Company-Specific Analysis**: Identifies keyword patterns for specific companies and industries
- **Experience-Level Targeting**: Separate analysis for experienced professionals and recent graduates
- **Skills Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing skills and provides recommendations

## Technical Architecture
The system is built using:
- Python and SQL integration via Databricks
- AWS EC2 for large-scale data processing
- Custom PySpark implementations
- N-gram/bigram text analysis, Machine Learning and Prediction Analysis
- Keyword frequency and co-occurrence analysis
- Topic modeling for job description analysis

## Data Processing Pipeline
```python
# Example of data processing flow
1. Initial data ingestion (LinkedIn job listings)
2. Data segmentation (700-800MB chunks)
3. Schema standardization
4. Text analysis and keyword extraction
5. Location data normalization
6. Skills taxonomy mapping
```
